# Weekend Getaway Ranker

This is a simple Python project that ranks tourist places for a weekend visit
based on rating, popularity, and time required to visit.

The project uses a public dataset of Indian tourist places and filters places
city-wise. A basic weighted scoring logic is used to rank the places.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas

## How It Works
- User enters a source city
- Places from that city are filtered
- Rating, popularity, and visit time are normalized
- A final score is calculated to rank the places
- 
## Notes
- The dataset does not contain distance, so visit duration is used instead
- This project is intended as a learning and demo project
